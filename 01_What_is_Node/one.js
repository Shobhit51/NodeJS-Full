Node.js is a server-side platform built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, developed by Ryan Dahl and a 
  team at Joyent in 2009. It is open-source, cross-platform, and initially released for Linux. Written in C, C++,
  and JavaScript, Node.js allows JavaScript to run outside the browser, thanks to the V8 engine's speed and C++'s
  system-level capabilities. This runtime environment uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, making it 
    lightweight and efficient for building real-time web applications. Its package ecosystem, NPM, is the largest
      collection of open-source libraries globally, simplifying the development process.
